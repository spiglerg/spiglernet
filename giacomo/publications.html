        In this study, we investigate the container delivery problem and explore ways to optimize the complex and nuanced system of inland container shipping. Our aim is to fulfill customer demand while maximizing customer service and minimizing logistics costs. To address the challenges posed by an unpredictable and rapidly-evolving environment, we examine the potential of leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the decision-making process and craft agile, efficient delivery schedules. Through a rigorous and comprehensive numerical study, we evaluate the efficacy of this approach by comparing the performance of several high-performance heuristic policies with that of agents trained using reinforcement learning, under various problem settings. Our results demonstrate that a reinforcement learning approach is robust and particularly useful for decision makers who must match logistics demand with capacity dynamically and have multiple objectives.

              Recent years have witnessed relevant advancements in the quality of life of persons with lower limb amputations thanks to the technological developments in prosthetics. However, prostheses that provide information about the footâ€“ground interaction, and in particular about terrain irregularities, are still missing on the market. The lack of tactile feedback from the foot sole might lead subjects to step on uneven terrains, causing an increase in the risk of falling. To address this issue, a biomimetic vibrotactile feedback system that conveys information about gait and terrain features sensed by a dedicated insole has been assessed with intact subjects. After having shortly experienced both even and uneven terrains, the recruited subjects discriminated them with an accuracy of 87.5%, solely relying on the replay of the vibrotactile feedback. With the objective of exploring the human decoding mechanism of the feedback startegy, a KNN classifier was trained to recognize the uneven terrains. The outcome suggested that the subjects achieved such performance with a temporal dynamics of 45 ms. This work is a leap forward to assist lower-limb amputees to appreciate the floor conditions while walking, adapt their gait and promote a more confident use of their artificial limb.

              Nowadays, lower-limb prostheses are reaching real-world usability especially on ground-level walking. However, some key tasks such as stair walking are still quite demanding. Providing haptic feedback about the foot placement on the steps might reduce the cognitive load of the task, compensating for increased dependency on vision and lessen the risk of falling. Experiments on intact subjects can be useful to define the feedback strategies prior to clinical trials, but effective methods to assess the efficacy of the strategies are few and usually rely on the emulation of the disability condition. The present study reports on the design and testing of a wearable haptic feedback system in a protocol involving intact subjects to assess candidate strategies to be adopted in clinical trials. The system integrated a sensorized insole wirelessly connected to a textile waist belt equipped with three vibrating motors. Three stimulation strategies for mapping the insole pressure data to vibrotactile feedback were implemented and compared in terms of intuitiveness and comfort perceived during level and stair walking. The strategies were ranked using a relative rating approach, which highlighted the differences between them and suggested guidelines for their improvement. The feedback evaluation procedure proposed could facilitate the selection and improvement of haptic feedback strategies prior to clinical testing.

              The effectiveness of haptic feedback devices highly depends on the perception of tactile stimuli, which differs across body parts and can be affected by movement. In this study, a novel wearable sensory feedback apparatus made of a pair of pressure-sensitive insoles and a belt equipped with vibrotactile units is presented; the device provides time-discrete vibrations around the waist, synchronized with biomechanically-relevant gait events during walking. Experiments with fifteen healthy volunteers were carried out to investigate users' tactile perception on the waist. Stimuli of different intensities were provided at twelve locations, each time synchronously with one pre-defined gait event (i.e. heel strike, flat foot or toe off), following a pseudo-random stimulation sequence. Reaction time, detection rate and localization accuracy were analyzed as functions of the stimulation level and site and the effect of gait events on perception was investigated. Results revealed that above-threshold stimuli (i.e. vibrations characterized by acceleration amplitudes of 1.92g and 2.13g and frequencies of 100 Hz and 150 Hz, respectively) can be effectively perceived in all the sites and successfully localized when the intertactor spacing is set to 10 cm. Moreover, it was found that perception of time-discrete vibrations was not affected by phase-related gating mechanisms, suggesting that the waist could be considered as a preferred body region for delivering haptic feedback during walking.

              Despite recent developments that allowed neural networks to achieve impressive performance on a variety of applications, these models are intrinsically affected by the problem of overgeneralization, due to their partitioning of the full input space into the fixed set of target classes used during training. Thus it is possible for novel inputs belonging to categories unknown during training or even completely unrecognizable to humans to fool the system into classifying them as one of the known classes, even with a high degree of confidence. This problem can lead to security problems in critical applications, and is closely linked to open set recognition and 1-class recognition. This paper presents a novel way to compute a confidence score using the reconstruction error of denoising autoencoders and shows how it can correctly identify the regions of the input space close to the training distribution. The proposed solution is tested on benchmarks of `fooling', open set recognition and 1-class recognition constructed from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

              This study investigates the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy of Izhikevich neuron models by numerically quantifying their convergence to provide design guidelines in choosing the limit time steps during a discretization procedure. This is important for bionic engineering and neuro-robotic applications where the use of embedded computational resources requires the introduction of optimality criteria. Specifically, the regular spiking (RS) and intrinsically bursting (IB) Izhikevich neuron models are evaluated with step inputs of various amplitudes. We analyze the convergence of spike sequences generated under different discretization time steps (10â€‰Âµs to 10â€‰ms), with respect to an ideal reference spike sequence approximated with a discretization time step of 1â€‰Âµs. The differences between the ideal reference and the computed spike sequences were quantified by Victorâ€“Purpura (VPd) and van Rossum (VRd) distances. For each distance, we found two limit discretization times (lower dt1 and upper dt2), as a function of the applied input and thus firing rate, beyond which the convergence is lost for each neuron model. The estimated limit time steps were found to be consistent regardless of metric used (VPd and VRd) and neuron type (RS and IB), but also to depend on the average inter-spike interval (ISI) produced by the neurons. However, in most cases, a good trade-off between the quality of the convergence of the models dynamics and the computational load required to simulate them numerically was found for values of the discretization time step between dt1â€¯âˆˆâ€¯(0.1â€‰ms, 1â€‰ms) and dt2â€¯âˆˆâ€¯(2â€‰ms, 3â€‰ms).

              Repetition suppression refers to a reduction in the cortical response to a novel stimulus that results from repeated presentation of the stimulus. We demonstrate repetition suppression in a well established computational model of cortical plasticity, according to which the relative strengths of lateral inhibitory interactions are modified by Hebbian learning. We present the model as an extension to the traditional account of repetition suppression offered by sharpening theory, which emphasises the contribution of afferent plasticity, by instead attributing the effect primarily to plasticity of intra-cortical circuitry. In support, repetition suppression is shown to emerge in simulations with plasticity enabled only in intra-cortical connections. We show in simulation how an extended â€˜inhibitory sharpening theoryâ€™ can explain the disruption of repetition suppression reported in studies that include an intermediate phase of exposure to additional novel stimuli composed of features similar to those of the original stimulus. The model suggests a re-interpretation of repetition suppression as a manifestation of the process by which an initially distributed representation of a novel object becomes a more localist representation. Thus, inhibitory sharpening may constitute a more general process by which representation emerges from cortical re-organisation.

              Restoration of touch after hand amputation is a desirable feature of ideal prostheses. Here, we show that texture discrimination can be artificially provided in human subjects by implementing a neuromorphic real-time mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT), which emulates to some extent the firing dynamics of SA1 cutaneous afferents. The MNT process was used to modulate the temporal pattern of electrical spikes delivered to the human median nerve via percutaneous microstimulation in four intact subjects and via implanted intrafascicular stimulation in one transradial amputee. Both approaches allowed the subjects to reliably discriminate spatial coarseness of surfaces as confirmed also by a hybrid neural model of the median nerve. Moreover, MNT-evoked EEG activity showed physiologically plausible responses that were superimposable in time and topography to the ones elicited by a natural mechanical tactile stimulation. These findings can open up novel opportunities for sensory restoration in the next generation of neuro-prosthetic hands.

              We conduct three studies by utilizing a crowd-sourced database called Happy DB Database, which consists of more than 100,000 descriptions of happy moments written by workers in Amazonâ€™s Machine Turk. Firstly, we apply a state-of-art word embedding algorithm BERT to transform all happy moments to context-sensitive representations to learn two critical concepts of happiness, agency and sociality. Our performance is better than that of the existing publications. Next, We study the association between alcohol consumption and happiness and our result suggests that both alcohol consumption and abstaining from drinking can lead to happiness. However, no association is found between gender and different drinking patterns in terms of breeding happiness. We also delve into happiness that results from interpersonal relationships and a significant association is found between gender and interpersonal relationships. Interestingly, men are more likely to get happy from the moments related to interpersonal connections, compared to their female counterparts.

              We present a simplified model of human mechano-receptors based on the Izhikevich artificial neuron model, and we show how the spikes-encoded information retains important spatio-temporal features of the perceived surfaces.

              We quantify the amount of forgetting on sequential Atari games learning by Deep Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, we show that while catastrophic forgetting is found to be highly disruptive in terms of the behavior of an agent, the changes to the parameters of its neural network are not as drastic as it could seem from the large drop in performance. Indeed, it is found that relatively short periods of retraining on previously learnt tasks are often sufficient to quickly recover and improve the lost performance.

              The present work investigates the neural mechanisms underlying the McCollough Effect through the simulation of three different models of color visual systems: a dichromatic and a trichromatic one that are inspired to the anatomy of the primatesâ€™ visual system and an idealised trichromatic model designed to aid the self-organization of a simulated Primary Visual Cortex to a physiologically-plausible level. The McCollough Effect allows for a direct investigation of cortical plasticity and homeostatic adaptation, and can provide a reference for works in the cortical modelling of color perception. Within this dissertation we compare our results to previous psychological data on humans and to the relevant work in modelling the effect, effectively reproducing its the main properties.
